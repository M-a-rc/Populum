# Muster today citizens and collectivities in the participatory democracy of tomorrow. 🌸


## What is populum ? 
*Populum* is a web application aiming at rebuilding the lost communication between citizens and local collectivities (e.g cities). It is based on the observation that action takers often struggle to adress the little daily struggles of citizens: a bus-stop dangerously located in the middle of the bike lane for instance... (true story 🏥👩🏼‍⚕️).
But why do they ? Well, as it turns out it is not by lack of concern, but rather because it is really hard for a municipal council to diagnose every little aspect of their city. On the other hand, representatives also have to overcome challenges. In France for instance municipal elections take place every 6 years. And between them, it is hard for representatives to get constructive feedback on their policies from the people. So election results are a bit of a surprise every time.

**Here comes Populum!** 

Populum enables citizens to post suggestions, react and upvote for other suggestions. The most popular suggestions are visualized by representatives from a convenient dashboard. Action takers can then update a specific suggestion's status, to 'we're considering it' or 'done!', so that citizens have feedback. Representatives can also build surveys and notify citizens, to gather tons of information !
